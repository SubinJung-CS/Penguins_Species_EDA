# Penguins Species EDA

This project is about the exploratory data analysis of Palmer Penguins dataset. Palmer Penguins dataset is collected by the Palmer Station located in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica (https://www.palmerstation.com/). The dataset is consisting of 8 different variables measured on 333 penguins:

- species (Adelie, Chinstrap or Gentoo)
- island that penguin lives (Biscoe, Dream or Torgerson)
- bill length
- bill depth
- flipper length
- body mass
- sex (male or female)
- year that measurements were taken

In accordance with those data, this study focuses on the estimation of population proportions, sex determination and the association with island.

The details can be found in the report in the repository.
